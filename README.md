# University Accessibility Plan Scraper <br> README File

This is my first larger programming project. My goal is to automate the process of gathering data on what various universities are doing to try to meet the April 24, 2026 deadline for compliance with the [updated ADA Title II requirements for digital accessibility](https://accessible.org/ada-title-ii-web-accessibility/).

This is mostly a project to learn programming, but I hope it will be useful when I'm finished. We'll see how often I update it.

## Directory... of Directories
ipeds-raw-data holds the 2023 raw data I downloaded from https://nces.ed.gov/. It's where I got my list of public, 4-year universities.
scrapy-demo is where I'm playing around to learn how to build a scraper with scrapy. Once I've got it figured out, I'll reorganize things for the actual implementation.

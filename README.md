# University Accessibility Plan Scraper <br> README File

This is my first larger programming project. My goal is to automate the process of gathering data on what various universities are doing to try to meet the April 24, 2026 deadline for compliance with the [updated ADA Title II requirements for digital accessibility](https://accessible.org/ada-title-ii-web-accessibility/).

This is mostly a project to learn programming, but I hope it will be useful when I'm finished. We'll see how often I update it.
